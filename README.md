## Why

In 2017 my wife proposed the development of a mobile app for the NHS Trust where she worked at that time as Quality Improvement Project which included clinical guidelines and medical protocols. I took the challenge to design and build a prototype, including a NodeJS server and react-native app. The project was abandoned due to the lack of hospital's IT support.
